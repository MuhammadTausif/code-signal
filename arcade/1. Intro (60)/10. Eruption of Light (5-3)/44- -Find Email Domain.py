"""
An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"),
 an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of
 letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however,
 also allows a lot of different special characters.
 Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Example

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "example.com";
For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "codesignal.com".
