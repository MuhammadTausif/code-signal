"""
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain
 a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be 
a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an.
 Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
solution(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
solution(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from  the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
